## File Name Parser Web Application

### Overview
This web application was created to automate and streamline the work of a document controller. In my role, I often faced the tedious and error-prone task of manually entering drawing details into Excel sheets, which are then uploaded to Aconex for project documentation and control.

### Problem Statement
Previously, every drawing required manual entry of its metadata (such as document number, revision, type, status, discipline, etc.) into an Excel file. This process was time-consuming, repetitive, and increased the risk of mistakes, especially when handling large batches of files.

### Solution
This app allows users to bulk upload drawing files. It automatically parses the filenames, extracts all required metadata, and generates a ready-to-upload Excel sheet in the correct format. This Excel can then be directly raised on Aconex, saving hours of manual work and reducing errors.

### Key Features
- **Bulk Upload:** Drag and drop or select multiple files at once.

### Benefits
- Saves significant time for document controllers.
- Reduces manual data entry errors.
- Ensures consistency in Excel uploads to Aconex.
- Improves productivity and job satisfaction.
